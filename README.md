This simple android app is a team project for JHU's OOSE class.
It is designed to be a traveling app helps users to browse interesting destinations, mark their wish-to-go places and create their own travel plans. Current code is a bare-bone demo for basic ideas about the original design.

To run the app, follow the below instrction:
1. Make sure that you have installed MySQL. Because server is configured with MySQL. Also a reminder, check the SQL port you are opening. Since in the app, we applied Hibernate as the communication tool with database. And the configuration file has set the port as 8889. If your sql port is not, change it or just change the hibernate.cfg file to make sure it works well.

2. Use MySQL build a database, name should be "hibernate"

3. run the Server.java in the server side folder.

4. Server start running, remember to close port each time when close server.
